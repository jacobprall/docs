Polar is a logic programming language developed to express and evaluate authorization logic. 

In a language like SQL, you write queries that specify the data you want the runtime engine to insert, update, or retrieve from storage. In a logic programming language like Polar, you ask questions that you want the runtime engine to answer using rules and facts.

**Rules** are conditional statements (if-then) that define relationships between actors, actions, and resources. For example, "users with the admin role can edit documents" might be a rule.

**Facts** define the data that rules operate on. For example, "user_1 is an admin" might be a fact.

To express this in Polar, we would write:

```
# fact:
has_role("user_1", "admin")

# rule: 
has_permission(actor: User, "edit", document: Document) if
  has_role(actor, "admin")
```

When you use Oso Cloud's `authorize` API, Polar's inference engine uses formal logic to evaluate the authorization question, given your rules and facts.

For example, your application may need to know `can user_1 edit document_1?`, or `what documents can user_1 edit?`.

```javascript
// can user_1 edit document_1?
const user = { id: "user_1", type: "User" }
const document = { id: "document_1", type: "Document" }
const authorized = await oso.authorize(user, "edit", document)
if (!authorized) {
    throw new Error("Action is not allowed");
}

// ...
```
