Oso decouples authorization from your application, so you can build fine-grained access control independently of your business logic. Model RBAC, ReBAC, ABAC or any other logic using Polar, our purpose-built language for authorization. Instead of writing ad-hoc permissions checks, you call our service to determine who can do what. Think feature flags, but for access control.
