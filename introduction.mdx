## What is Oso Cloud?
Oso Cloud is an authorization-as-a-service designed for microservices and complex applications. It centralizes your authorization logic and exposes APIs for answering authorization questions.

## How it works

1. **Define** authorization policies in [Polar](#), our DSL for expressing permissions logic
2. **Store** policies and authorization data in Oso Cloud
3. **Make API calls** from your app when you need to answer authorization questions, like `can user X view Z resource?` or `what resources can user X edit?`

## Writing policies in Polar
Oso Cloud's policy language, Polar, is designed for expressing arbitrarily complex and granular application authorization logic. 

Polar can express any model, including [RBAC](#), [ReBAC](#), [ABAC](#), [fine-grained authorization](#), [organizational hierarchies](#), and more.

## Data management
Oso Cloud provides a prescriptive data model for authorization-relevant data, called **facts**. 

There are multiple ways to **provide facts to Oso Cloud**. Which one you choose depends on your use case and application architecture.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title='Centralize in Oso Cloud'>
   Data that is exclusively or extensively used for authorization, like users, roles, and permissions are best stored in Oso Cloud as facts. Oso Cloud provides a robust mechanism for synchronizing data stores and detecting drift with [Oso Sync](#).
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Finish evaluations with your local database">
    Oso Cloud supports centralizing your data, but doesn't require it. [Local authorization](#) is our unique approach to minimizing data synchronization and data transfer. When you make a request to the Oso Cloud API, you receive back database logic that can be executed against your local data store to finish the authorization evaluation.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Provide data at request time">
    Oso Cloud also supports providing data at request time, called [context facts](#). This is useful when you have data that is not used regularly for authorization, but is needed to evaluate the request.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>


## Evaluating authorization requests
Oso Cloud can return booleans, a list of resources, a list of permissions, or even database logic that can be used to complete an authorization decision.

It all depends on your unique application requirements.
