### Prerequisites

To get started, you'll need an Oso Cloud account. Create one [here](https://ui.osohq.com).

<Steps>
  <Step title="Install and configure the Oso Cloud CLI">
    Navigate to the directory where you want to create your policy.

    Run the following command to install the Oso Cloud CLI:
    ```bash
    curl -L https://cloud.osohq.com/install.sh | bash
    which oso-cloud
    ```

    Once installed, configure the CLI with your Oso Cloud API key found in the Oso Cloud UI.
    ```bash
    export OSO_AUTH=<your_oso_api_key>
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create your first policy">
    Building authorization with Oso Cloud requires authorization policies and user data. 

    Policies are defined in [Polar](#), our DSL for expressing permissions logic. Run the following command to create a new Polar policy file:
    ```bash
    touch main.polar
    ```

    There are two kinds of entities in a Polar policy: actors and resources. 
    * **Resources** are the core building blocks of your authorization model. They map to entities in your application. 
    * **Actors** are a special kind of resource. They define entities that can perform actions on a resource.
    
    First, we define an empty actor **User**, and a resource **Item** with some basic permissions.

    ```polar main.polar
    actor User {}
    resource Item {
      roles = ["viewer", "editor", "owner"]
      permissions = ["read", "write", "delete"]

      "read" if "viewer"
      "write" if "editor"
      "delete" if "owner"

      "viewer" if "editor" 
      "editor" if "owner"
    }
    ```

    The `roles` and `permissions` fields define the roles and permissions that can be assigned to a resource.

    The "read", "write", and "delete" rules define the actions that can be performed on the `Item` resource by actors with the "viewer", "editor", and "owner" roles.
    
    The "viewer" and "editor" rules allow the "editor" and "owner" to inherit the permissions of the "viewer" and "editor" roles, respectively.
    
    Run this command to upload the policy to Oso Cloud:
    ```bash
    oso-cloud policy main.polar
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add facts">
    Facts are pieces of data that define the current state of users and resources in Oso Cloud. You can add Facts in Oso Cloud using an Oso Cloud client, or in the Workbench console.
     
     Run this command to insert a fact that defines two users and their roles on an `Item` resource:
     ```bash
     oso-cloud tell has_role User:bob "owner" Item:item1
     oso-cloud tell has_role User:alice "viewer" Item:item1
     ```
    The command `oso-cloud tell` inserts a fact into Oso Cloud. The arguments include:
    *  **Predicate**: has_role is the kind of the fact to insert. It takes 3 arguments, an actor, a permission, and a resource.
    *  **Permission**: The action that the actor can perform on the resource.
    *  **Resource Type:Resource ID**: a type and ID pair that the fact is referencing. Arguments without a type are given type `String`.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Evaluate your first request">
    The `authorize` command evaluates a request to determine if an actor has a permission on a resource.
    ```bash
    oso-cloud authorize User:bob "write" Item:item1
    ```

    To verify user Alice cannot delete the item, run the following command:
    ```bash
    oso-cloud authorize User:alice "delete" Item:item1
    ```

    To list all items user Alice can view, run the following command:
    ```bash
    oso-cloud list User:alice "read" Item
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

Congratulations! We completed our first authorization with Oso.
