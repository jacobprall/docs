Oso Cloud is an authorization-as-a-service. It centralizes your authorization logic and exposes APIs for answering authorization questions.

## How it works

1. **Define** authorization policies in [Polar](/core-concepts/policies/overview), our DSL for expressing permissions logic
2. **Store** policies and authorization data, called [facts](/core-concepts/facts/overview), in Oso Cloud
3. **Make API calls** with our [client SDKs](/api-reference/cloud-api/policy/get-policy) from your app when you need to answer authorization questions, like `can user X view Z resource?` or `what resources can user X edit?`

## Writing policies in Polar
Oso Cloud's policy language, Polar, is designed for expressing arbitrarily complex and granular application authorization logic. 

Polar can express any model, including [RBAC](/core-concepts/policies/rbac), [ReBAC](/core-concepts/policies/rebac), [ABAC](/core-concepts/policies/abac), [fine-grained authorization](/core-concepts/policies/fga), [organizational hierarchies](/core-concepts/policies/organizational-hierarchies), and more.

## Data management
**Facts** are a prescriptive data model for authorization-relevant data.

There are multiple ways to **provide facts to Oso Cloud**. Which one you choose depends on your use case and application architecture.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title='Centralized in Oso Cloud'>
   Data that is exclusively or extensively used for authorization, like users, roles, and permissions are best [stored in Oso Cloud](/core-concepts/facts/overview) as facts. Oso Cloud provides a robust mechanism for synchronizing data stores and detecting drift with [Oso Sync](/core-concepts/facts/sync).
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Stored in your local database">
    Oso Cloud supports centralizing your data, but doesn't require it. [Local authorization](/core-concepts/facts/local-authorization) is our unique approach to minimizing data synchronization and data transfer. When you make a request to the Oso Cloud API, you receive back database logic that can be executed against your local data store to finish the authorization evaluation.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Provided at request time">
    Oso Cloud also supports providing data at request time, called [context facts](/core-concepts/facts/context-facts). This is useful when you have data that is not used regularly for authorization, but is needed to evaluate the request.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>


## Evaluating authorization requests
Oso Cloud can return [booleans](/api-reference/cloud-api/check-api/post-authorize), a [list of resources](/api-reference/cloud-api/check-api/post-authorized_resources), a [list of permissions](/api-reference/cloud-api/check-api/post-actions), or even [database logic](/api-reference/local-check-api/post-authorize_query) that can be used to complete an authorization decision.

It all depends on your application requirements.
